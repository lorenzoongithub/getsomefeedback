DESCRIPTION
===========

getfeedback.js is the simplest javascript library to add a 'feedback' form to any of your webpages. 

USAGE
=====

Add the script at the bottom of your page. 

<script src="getfeedback.js></script>

End of story. 
 

A 100% JAVASCRIPT SOLUTION: HOW DOES IT WORK ?
==============================================

The script at the bottom of your page creates and display a 'feedback' button on. 
The user clicks on it and a pop-up appears to enter his/her feedback.

When 'submit feedback' is pressed a new http request is made to the hosting site - your website -
passing all of the user's parameters.
This is done via a well known technique known as dynamic script injection. 
The http request returns nothing to the client but the 'feedback' will be written on your server's logs.  

HOW DO I CUSTOMIZE IT ? 
=======================

Feedback forms vary greatly and each website has its own requirement on how to integrate them.
The best way to customize this script is to go and adapt this script for your site. 
I worked very hard to make the code as simple as possible.
The javascript is about 100 lines of code.
